## WDI Instructor Code Challenge

### GOAL

> Create a single page application that will display movie data. The client side application will have the ability to persist data.
 
### Overview
> To complete the assessment: 

- Spend no more than 6 hours to complete as much as you can.
- Submit your code by uploading your file to the upload link included in the email you received earlier.
- Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions!  After you complete the assessment, we will be in touch regarding next steps within 24 hours.

#### Technical 

> Use React to create a single page application which satisfies the user stories below


#### User Stories 

1. As a user I should be able to see movies listed on the left side of the application.
2. As a user I should be able to select a movie from the list and have that movie's information displayed. 
3. As a user I should be able to click a favorite button and have that movie saved to my list of favorites. 
4. As a user I should be able to go to a "favorite" section and see my previously saved movies appear in a list of favorites.
5. As a user I should be able to remove a favorited movie from my list of favorites.


#### Notes

- Included is TMDB.js, which provides you with a list of movies and relevant data. 

- We have provided the basic file structure. You may follow this or use your own discretion. 

- When the user clicks on a movie from the list, display detailed information about that movie on the right side.
  - *Example*: If a user is viewing a list of every movie in TMDB.js and clicks on `Blade Runner 2049`, detailed information about that specific movie will be displayed.

- Use local storage or the file system to store favorites.

- Provide a link to display favorited movies. Display them as a list in the same area you display search results. 

- Styling should be as similar to the following image.
